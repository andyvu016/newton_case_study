# FinTech Case Study: Newton, The Startup that Made Cryptocurrencies Accessible to Canadians

## Overview and Origin

Newton Crypto Ltd. is a FinTech startup company co-founded by Dustin Walper, Erynn Saunders, and Tyson Leslie. The company was officially incorporated on January 31, 2018. At the time, there was a lack of an easy way for Canadians to buy cryptocurrencies. The goal of Newton was to solve this problem.

The idea for Newton was amazing but cannot come into fruition without the necessary funding. Luckily for Newton, it's co-founders were not just ordinary people. They all had great potential to make their idea a reality. This is what the co-founder of DV Trading, Dino Verbrugge, saw in Dustin Walper, stating “Dustin’s entrepreneurial flair, combined with his past achievements, made him and Newton the ideal partner to work with and invest in.” Hence in 2018, DV Chain and Independent Trading Group invested $15 million USD in debt and equity into the startup.

## Business Activities

At Newton, they "believe that cryptocurrency represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make our financial system more fair and democratic." However, in 2018, interested Canadians had no safe, affordable, and intuitive way to get a hold of cryptocurrencies. Newton was built with accessibility in mind. Newton does not charge users commission or trading fees. This includes no fee funding and withdrawing in CAD. They also waive up to $5 in network fees when depositing or withdrawing crypto. The biggest edge they have are their prices, in which Newton guarantees that theirs will be lower than their competition.

Newton's intended customer base has grown significantly since their inception. The Ontario Securities Commission Survey in 2022 found that 13% of Canadians own crypto assets, and 31% are interested in purchasing crypto assets. To make sure Newton captures most of this demographic, they made sure to implement the latest technologies to provide the best user experience. 

As a crypto broker, the obvious technology that Newton uses are cryptocurrencies and blockchain. They currently support over 70 cryptocurrencies including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano and USDC. Newton assures that “Due diligence is in our DNA” and only support cryptocurrencies that pass securities test and Newton being able to support the assets with liquidity, proper wallet support and cold custody.

There are also other technologies that Newton uses that improves the user experience. To be the most accessible, Newton’s platform is available in their web app and have a mobile app for both iOS and Android. Newton also implemented Interac e-Transfer, a widely used service in Canada that allows funds to be sent between banks and other financial institutions. With Interact e-Transfer, CAD deposits and withdrawals can be quickly made in and out of Newton’s platform. Newton also supports Authy Push Authentication, a two-factor authentication service that uses RSA key pairs to authorize login requests. Authy makes it so that logging into Newton requires approval from the mobile device that has been tethered to Authy each time. This method is significantly more secure than traditional SMS two-factor authentication, due to SMS being prone to SIM swap and Man-In-The-Middle attacks. Ultimately, these technologies make using Newton effortless and secure.  

## Landscape

Being a part of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies domain of the financial industry means that there are major advancements and innovation in the space everyday. Blockchain is the underlying technology that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are built on. Just in the last 5 years, there has been an influx of new users of cryptocurrency. As controversial and speculative most cryptocurrencies are, the last decade has allowed Bitcoin to prove its worth with history. El Salvador became the first nation adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. In the same year, CI Global Asset Management became the first company ever to offer their clients ETFs and mutual funds that invest directly into Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Ethereum became the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization just behind Bitcoin. A potential major concern for blockchain technology is the high amount of energy needed to verify transactions onto the blockchain. This is only the case for blockchains that use “proof-of-work” algorithms. This algorithm is what is used by Bitcoin and was used by Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum moved to a “proof-of-stake” algorithm in 2022. The “proof-of-stake” model for blockchains is significantly less energy intensive, pushing the initiative for greener and eco-friendly blockchains.

Blockchain technology has been proven to have potential to vastly improve supply chains. This came to be as a by-product of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has created a high demand for vaccines in which require integrity at every stage of the supply chain. Due to the volume of vaccines required, tracking and distribution has been proven difficult and with major points of concern. There is potential for batches to be counterfeited, gone bad due to storing at incorrect temperatures, or have unusual side effects. This is where a pilot project showed that blockchain technology can be used to track each batch to quickly validate the integrity of the vaccines from manufacturing, distribution, and management.

The reality is that the blockchain and cryptocurrencies domain is vast with many contributors. There are many major companies that specialize in certain areas in this domain. For instance, Coinbase is a company whose platform is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, serving over 100 million users worldwide. There is also Riot Blockchain, which is a company that owns the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America. Then there is NVIDIA, whose major role is developing the hardware used to mine cryptocurrencies. There is also the tech giant, Microsoft, who is helping to establish blockchain technology into companies in various sectors. 

Direct competitors to Newton in the Canadian market include companies like Bitvo, Coinberry, Netcoins, VirgoCX  and Wealthsimple. While the products and services from each of these companies have some overlap with each other, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the user to compare and contrast to see which company best suit their needs.

## Results

The early success of Newton has started to make big waves to investors. It was about time to scale the business further. This was when Newton was able to secure a $20 million USD Series B funding round led by DV Chain in 2022. This brought new investors into Newton including  various venture capital firms such as Singh Capital Partners, Tiny Capital and Snowdevil Capital, which is owned by Shopify co-founder Tobias Lutke. They also received funding from the asset and wealth management firm CI Financial. The aftermath of this Series B funding round brough Newton’s valuation to approximately $200 million USD.

Newton has established themselves as a trustworthy company making cryptocurrency accessible to thousands of Canadians. They have not only built a reputation to Canadians, but to regulators as well. In 2022, Newton became one of the first companies of its kind to register with the Ontario Securities Commission. Although this imposes various new restrictions on users, this allows Newton to continue to operate in Ontario after the Ontario Securities Commission started cracking down on other cryptocurrency service providers.

Some core metrics that companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies domain use to measure success are acquisition and referrals. Acquisition refers to the number of new users the company can bring to their platform and referrals refer to the likelihood of current users recommending the platform to others. Newton has had consistent growth throughout the years causing them to have to increase the size of their team on numerous occasions. Newton has over 500 reviews with a 4.4/5 average rating on Trustpilot with 68% of the reviews being 5-star. More significantly, the Newton app has over 17 thousand reviews with a 4.6/5 average rating on the Apple App Store and over 5 thousand reviews with a 4.2/5 average rating on the Google Play Store.

Considering the size of Newton and their goals, they are doing well relative to competitors in the same domain. Since their target audience are Canadians who have had no prior experience with cryptocurrencies, they want to keep their platform simple and user-friendly. Newton claims a “plan for longevity” and “data informed decisions” to be a few key philosophies of their company. Although their competitors may offer more services, Newton focuses on improving and perfecting the basics.  

## Recommendations

At Newton's current standing, they have sufficient means to experiment with new product and/or service offerings. Today, payments in cash are being utilized less and less in favour of cards. A possible suggestion for a product Newton could offer is a credit card that gives cashback rewards in cryptocurrency. There is a lack of such products in the Canadian market and offering it could potentially bring in new customers. Such a product will allow users to passively invest in cryptocurrencies when they make purchases with the card. It will also give users who want to spend their cryptocurrencies directly a means to do so. Such a product will require to utilizing the technology of the Visa or Mastercard network to process credit card transactions. 

The recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has uncovered many potential use cases. A possible suggestion for a service Newton could offer is an AI that creates a portfolio of cryptocurrencies that the user can invest in given their risk tolerance and goals. There are many startup companies like Vise, who are already looking into using AI to personalize stock portfolios. Blockchain technology used by cryptocurrencies means that big data on any cryptocurrency is readily available for ML models. Vise’s co-founder, Samir Vasavada believes that such technology will “personalizes portfolios to a degree never before seen.” If Newton could implement such a service, it will provide users a way to investing into various cryptocurrencies without putting in time and resources to do research.
